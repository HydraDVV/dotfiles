# Polybar Configurations
- A repository that contains my Polybar configuration files and related scripts.
- Polybar is an highly configurable text based menu bar that is commonly used with
tiled window managers. Check out <a href="https://github.com/polybar/polybar">Polybar</a>.
- I divided the bar configrations as config, bars and modules.
