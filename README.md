# .dotfiles
<a href="bin/">Scripts</a>


- This repository contains configuration settings and scripts that I've made or
used on my Operating System. These are the base dotfiles that I start with
when I set up a new environment.
- I'm using Fedora 35 on my personal computer. I use a fork of
<a href="https://github.com/i3/i3">i3 Window Manager</a> called <a href="https://github.com/Airblader/i3">i3-gaps</a>.

## How To Install

If you are using Fedora as your operating system, you can just run `install.sh`.

```bash
chmod +x ./install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

It will then download all required files and replace config files with my configurations.

## Polybar Configurations

- Polybar is an highly configurable text based menu bar that is commonly used with
tiled window managers. Check out <a href="https://github.com/polybar/polybar">Polybar</a>.
- I divided the bar configrations as config, bars and modules.
